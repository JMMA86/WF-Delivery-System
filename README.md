## Executing Information

On the right you will see a Toggle Button to change the way the program calculates the paths, either via adjacency list or matrix. You can select any house or headquarter by clicking it. To unselect a house, click in any place of the canvas.

The three buttons on the left bottom corner allows you to generate paths and see the graph representations, there must be a house selected to check the delivery path.

The window is completely responsive, so you can adjust the size in any way. You can also make scroll to zoom in and out, if you want to see more clearly the weights of the streets.

It is not recommendable to scroll while the path is being generated, because it can cause a bad performance. The minimum supported resolution is 800x600.
